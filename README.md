This project is not intended for deployment.

Louvre Roulette is a React project to fulfill the fifth project requirement for Flatiron School Boot Camp. Unfortunately the project suffered some scope shift and scope creep over the course of building and at this point I'm not entirely sure what I'm going to do with it, deploy it as is or keep the concept and scrap the code, rebuilding it elsewhere.

The architecture of the project as it stands currently involves a gallery object and an artwork object. A gallery can have many artworks, and an artwork belongs to a gallery. No images were harmed in the making of this project, and no images are displayed; this is purely data being shuffled around. The gallery object has a title and a description; the artwork object has several attributes including style, medium, subject, and hours worked. The originally intended main focus of this project was to track how much time an artist (me, mainly) spent on a particular subject, medium, or in a particular style. This remains the focus for future versions of this project, which may simply involve creating a resume-like object for an artist involving user objects and login function, the ability to create a personal statement and link to a portfolio, with artworks being not visible to the public. 

This project will remain public and viewable on GitHub and will continue to be updated as a practice project.
